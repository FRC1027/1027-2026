Note: When viewed from the top, make sure the sides of the wheel with the bevel gear are pointing to the left
Step 1: Module Types
Model, Version, Etc
Motor				| Ion Neo v1.1 brushless REV-21-1650 for both
Controller			| Spark Max
Absolute Encoder	| CTRE SRX Mag Encoder
IMU					| NavX2 - XMP
SDS MK4i L3 - 6.12 / 1.0


Step 2: Build Specific Details
1. Measure the module center relative to the robot center
Module - Location (Inches) X | Location (Inches) Y
Front Left (FL) - 	+20.3125 | +20.3125
Front Right (FR) - 	+20.3125 | -20.3125
Back Left (BL) - 	-20.3125 | +20.3125
Back Right (BR) - 	-20.3125 | -20.3125
2. Measure the wheel diameter in meters
3. Determine the reported internal encoder resolution
	a. Note: Most encoders now normalize the reported values to -1 to 1, so the Encoder Resolution
	when computing the conversion factors should generally be “1”. One known exception is the
	TalonSRX.
4. Find the drive/angle gear ratio from the swerve module manufacturer specs
5. Calculate the drive/angle conversion factors
	a. Drive Motor Conversion Factor (meters/rotation) = (PI * WHEEL DIAMETER IN METERS) /
	(GEAR RATIO * ENCODER RESOLUTION)
	b. Angle Motor Conversion Factor (degrees/rotation) = 360 / (GEAR RATIO * ENCODER
	RESOLUTION)
Note: For Absolute Encoders attached directly to the dataport on the SparkMAX, the Conversion Factor is
360

Motor 	Wheel Diameter (meters) | Encoder Resolution (CPR)	| Gear Ratio	| Conversion Factor
Drive 		0.1016				| 		1024 				| 	6.12		|	x
Angle 		0.1016				| 		1024 				| 	6.12		|	x



Step 3: Electrical Characteristics
6. Set/Verify the CAN IDs for each module
Note: Update the FW for each module and reset any stored settings to factory defaults
		 Motor/Encoder CAN IDs
Module 		 Drive 	| Angle | Absolute Encoder
Front Left (FL)	 2	| 1		| 12
Front Right (FR) 3	| 4 	| 11
Back Left (BL)	 6	| 5		| 13
Back Right (BR)	 8	| 7		| 14

7. Check Inversion
	a. Rotate the drive wheel CCW (moving “forward”)
	The built-in encoder value should increase. If not, invert the drive motor.
	b. Rotate the angle wheel CCW (when viewed from the top)
	The built-in encoder value should increase. If not, invert the angle motor.
	The absolute encoder value should increase. If not, invert the absolute encoder.
	c. Rotate the entire robot CCW.
	The gyro angle (yaw) should increase. If not, invert the IMU
Note: If you are using the hardware utilities for accessing the motors controllers and/or absolute encoders, the
RoboRio must not be active on the CAN bus. The most reliable way to disable the RoboRio, without affecting
the CAN BUS termination, is to temporarily disconnect it from power by pulling the 10A fuse on the Power
Distribution Panel (PDP) and then power cycle the robot.

					Inverted?
Module			Drive	| Angle	| Absolute Encoder	| IMU
Front Left (FL)		x	| x		| 	x				| x
Front Right (FR)	x	| x		|	x				| x
Back Left (BL)		x	| x		|	x				| x
Back Right (BR)		x	| x		|	x				| x



Step 4: Absolute Encoder Offsets
8. Turn Robot On (Disabled so the wheels can be turned manually)
9. Manually Turn All 4 wheels so that they are all pointing forward and forward rotation results in
increasing drive encoder values (see the black arrows in Orientation Diagram).
10. Measure the absolute encoder value for each module
Module				| Angle Absolute Offset (degrees)
Front Left (FL)		|	x
Front Right (FR)	|	x
Back Left (BL)		|	x
Back Right (BR)		|	x
